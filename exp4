To subnet a **Class C address (192.168.240.0/24)** into two subnets that can accommodate 50 hosts each, let's break down the process and calculations:

### Step-by-Step Subnetting:

1. **Given Address**: 192.168.240.0/24
   - **Class C** addresses have a default subnet mask of **255.255.255.0 (/24)**, meaning the first three octets (192.168.240) are the network part, and the last octet (0) is the host part.

2. **Hosts Requirement**:
   - Each subnet needs to accommodate **50 hosts**.
   - The formula to calculate the required number of host bits is:
     \[
     2^h - 2 \geq \text{number of hosts}
     \]
     - Where **h** is the number of host bits, and we subtract 2 (one for the network address and one for the broadcast address).

     For 50 hosts, the minimum number of bits needed:
     \[
     2^6 - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62
     \]
     So, 6 bits are required for hosts. That leaves us with **2 bits for subnetting**.

3. **Subnet Mask**:
   - With **2 bits** used for subnetting, the new subnet mask is:
     \[
     /24 + 2 = /26 \quad (\text{or } 255.255.255.192)
     \]
     This gives us 4 subnets, and each subnet can support up to 62 hosts.

### Subnet Calculation:

#### 1. **Subnet 1** (First 62 Hosts):
   - **Network Address**: 192.168.240.0  
   - **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.192 (/26)  
   - **Usable IP Range**:  
     - **From**: 192.168.240.1  
     - **To**: 192.168.240.62  
   - **Broadcast Address**: 192.168.240.63  

#### 2. **Subnet 2** (Next 62 Hosts):
   - **Network Address**: 192.168.240.64  
   - **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.192 (/26)  
   - **Usable IP Range**:  
     - **From**: 192.168.240.65  
     - **To**: 192.168.240.126  
   - **Broadcast Address**: 192.168.240.127  

### Subnets Breakdown:
1. **Subnet 1**:  
   - Network Address: 192.168.240.0/26  
   - Usable IP range: 192.168.240.1 - 192.168.240.62  
   - Broadcast Address: 192.168.240.63  

2. **Subnet 2**:  
   - Network Address: 192.168.240.64/26  
   - Usable IP range: 192.168.240.65 - 192.168.240.126  
   - Broadcast Address: 192.168.240.127  

This provides two subnets, each capable of hosting up to 62 hosts (more than enough for the 50 hosts required).

### Packet Tracer Design:

In **Cisco Packet Tracer**, follow these steps:
1. **Create the Network**:
   - Assign the first subnet (192.168.240.0/26) to one part of the network (e.g., a switch connected to a router).
   - Assign the second subnet (192.168.240.64/26) to another part of the network (e.g., another switch or a different department).
   
2. **Router Configuration**:
   - Configure the router to handle both subnets by creating two interfaces (or sub-interfaces) for each subnet:
     - **Router Interface for Subnet 1**: Assign an IP from 192.168.240.1-62.
     - **Router Interface for Subnet 2**: Assign an IP from 192.168.240.65-126.

3. **Host Assignments**:
   - Ensure that each host device in the network gets a unique IP address within its respective subnet range.
   - Set the **default gateway** for each host to the corresponding router interface's IP address for that subnet.

By configuring the network like this in Packet Tracer, you will have two functional subnets with 50 hosts each.
